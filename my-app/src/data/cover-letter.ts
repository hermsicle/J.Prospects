export const COVER_LETTER_EXAMPLE = `

I’ve led frontend development for GenAI-driven SaaS and enterprise platforms that transformed complex data—spanning financial, operational, and knowledge insights—into intuitive, high-performance user interfaces. 

With 4+ years of experience in React, TypeScript, and Tailwind, I’ve built responsive dashboards, real-time visualizations, and onboarding flows used by thousands of users. 

I’ve worked closely with AI and backend teams to ship user-first features in fast-paced environments, and I thrive in cross-functional, early-stage teams where speed, design precision, and customer empathy matter. 

I’m passionate about building financial tools that turn raw data into meaningful decisions—and excited by the opportunity to do that at the frontier of AI.
